# Emotion Recognition in Conversations

This repository contains implementations for three conversational emotion detection methods, namely:
- CMN (tensorflow)
- ICON (tensorflow)
- DialogueRNN (PyTorch)

Unline other emotion detection models, these techniques consider the party-states and inter-party dependencies for modeling conversational context relevant to emotion recognition. The primary purpose of all these techniques are to pretrain an emotion detection model for empathetic dialogue generation.

## CMN
[_CMN_](http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1193) is a neural framework for emotion detection in dyadic conversations. It leverages mutlimodal signals from text, audio and visual modalities. It specifically incorporates speaker-specific dependencies into its architecture for context modeling. Summaries are then generated from this context using multi-hop memory networks.

## DialogueRNN: An Attentive RNN for Emotion Detection in Conversations

[_DialogueRNN_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00405.pdf) is basically a customized recurrent neural network (RNN) that
profiles each speaker in a conversation/dialogue on the fly, while models the
context of the conversation at the same time. This model can easily be extended to
multi-party scenario. Also, it can be used as a pretraining model for empathetic
dialogue generation.

### Requirements

- Python 3
- PyTorch 0.4
- Pandas 0.23
- Scikit-Learn 0.20
- TensorFlow (optional; required for tensorboard)
- tensorboardX (optional; required for tensorboard)

### Execution

1. _IEMOCAP_ dataset: `python train_IEMOCAP.py`
2. _AVEC_ dataset: `python train_AVEC.py`
